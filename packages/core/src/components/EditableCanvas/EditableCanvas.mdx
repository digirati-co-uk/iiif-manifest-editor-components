# Editable Canvas

The original canvas editor component used in the initial development phase.

<Props of={EditableCanvas} />

## Current issues

- It doesn't handle tile sources therefore the overall performance is poorer than the canvas panel version could be.
- Zoom level doesn't reset when the displayed canvas changed which results some inconveniences during the editig process.


## Requirements

- [x] being able to drop items
- [x] being able to resize items
- [x] being able to display multiple annotations at the same time
- [x] annotation order preserved
- [x] zoom controls (in/out/reset/fit)
