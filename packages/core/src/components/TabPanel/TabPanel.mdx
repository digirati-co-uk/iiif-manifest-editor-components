# Tab Panel

Very simple tab bar implementation.

- [ ] current tab controlled by the state.

Can host React components or simple html elements.

If a title property specified, that will be displayed as the tab header. 
Otherwise for React Components it displays the component name with spaces inserted between the camel case uppercanse letters.
So for example `CollectionExplorer` will turn into `Collection Explorer`. 
Simple HTML elements without title will use the HTML element's tag name.
