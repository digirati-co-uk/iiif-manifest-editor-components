# Panel

Creates common look for the different ui elements (it is just a BEM shell for the components).

The following structural components available:

- **Panel** - main panel element (horizontal modifier)
- **Panel.Header** - panel title, maybe a collapse/expand button 
- **Panel.Toolbar** - Common tools for panels (can be placed top/bottom)
- **Panel.Content** - this area is stretching to occupy the remaining size.

**TODO**: consider not using `fesk-bem` because `material-ui` has it's own way of 
styling and themeing and it would be easier to only use one system.
