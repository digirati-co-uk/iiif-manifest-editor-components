# Panel

Creates common look for the different ui elements (it is just a BEM shell for the components).

The following structural components available:

- Panel - main panel element (horizontal modifier)
- Panel.Header - panel title, maybe a collapse/expand button 
- Panel.Toolbar - Common tools for panels (can be placed top/bottom)
- Panel.Content - this area is stretching to occupy the remaining size.
