# Translation Dialog

This is the first sketch of the mirror translation dialog. It will allow users quickly translate manifests. 
This requires further optimizations on the data access layer because the typing is a bit delayed due to 
the extensive traversal (in order to find the target elements).

Also it would be a good idea to separate the dialog's component from the actual listing component.
