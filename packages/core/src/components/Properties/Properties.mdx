# Property Editor

The component displays the editable properties of the seleced IIIF Resources (Manifests, Canvases and Annotations). 
This editor follows the IIIF presentation V3 terminology. For details please read:

[https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/)


The following common properties are editable at the moment:

- [Label](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#label): A human readable label, name or title.
- [Summary](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#summary): A short textual summary intended to be conveyed to the user when the metadata entries for the resource are not being displayed. 
- [Required Statement](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#requiredstatement): Text that must be displayed when the resource is displayed or used. For example, the requiredStatement property could be used to present copyright or ownership statements, an acknowledgement of the owning and/or publishing institution, or any other text that the organization deems critical to display to the user.
- [Metadata](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#metadata): An ordered list of descriptions to be displayed to the user when they interact with the resource, given as pairs of human readable label and value entries.
- [Rights](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#rights): A string that identifies a license or rights statement that applies to the content of the resource, such as the JSON of a Manifest or the pixels of an image. 
- [Navdate](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#navdate): A date that clients may use for navigation purposes when presenting the resource to the user in a time-based user interface, such as a calendar or timeline.
