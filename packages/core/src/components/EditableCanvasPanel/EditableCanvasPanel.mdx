# Editable Canvas Panel

This version of the canvas editor is using canvas panel.

<Props of={EditableCanvasPanel} />

## Current Issues

- `Canvas Panel` doesn't really supports media types other than *images*.
- The components extensibility relies on the `Canvas Panel` project which slows down the development.
- Even if the videos will be implemented as overlays, there are certain situations when we need to make cuts on the functionality:
  - Videos will be always on top, no free ordering of the annotations (unlike the raw `HTML` primitive based implementation)
  - `HTML` *Audio*/*Video* synchronization nightmare will not be resolved in the scope of this project.
- `Canvas Panel` using `Open Sea Dragon` on the bottom which is not a `React` application, therefore it is a bit hackish to access 
  certain parameters, and the `UI` heavily relies on `DOM` references, which we trying to avoid in a React project usually.
- At the moment, all annotations displayed as an overlay in order to be able to drag and drop and resize the resources.
    - This introduces another issue. The mouse wheel zoom, above the annotations, is not working, although this will 
    be an easy fix by using a custom Open Sea Dragon Mouse tracker (I guess).

*NOTE*

Possible solution for the aforementioned issues is an `A-Frame` based canvas renderer. `A-Frame` is 
relatively easy to code declarative environment. On the other hand, the React implementation performs poorly, so probably the best to 
implement it in a separate sandbox before applying it to the current codebase. 

The main benefits of `A-Frame` are the following:

- Supports the all the required web primitives, only IIIF tile source loader needs to be implemented.
- It is using webGL on the bottom, ergo the rendering is hardware accelerated.
- It allows new types of content as well, for example 3D laser scans of objects can be also displayed (also built in panoramic videos, image cubes). 
- As well as the AR support is native to this framework.

It is not a surprise that `A-Frame` comes with it's own limitations, so pease see the following list for the possible drawbacks:

- The react implementation of `A-Frame` performs poorly compared to the base implementation.
- The GPU has to stream in the textures, ergo they appear delayed.
- And in general GPUs usually support texture sizes 2^n (power of 2 - ...16, 32, 64, 128, 256...), so additional logic needs to be introduced if IIIF Image server has different sizes.
- If something goes wrong it crashes the entire webpage (and by something I don't just mean code related mistakes, WebGL is running on a quasi random environment much more close to the hardware with less protection as reguar web code)
- There's no IIIF viewer support for the created content at the moment.


## Requirements

- [x] being able to drop items
- [x] being able to resize items
- [x] being able to display multiple annotations at the same time
- [x] annotation order preserved
- [x] zoom controls (in/out/reset/fit)
