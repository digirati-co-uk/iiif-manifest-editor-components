# Editor Context

Different institutions have different needs, this component allows to create pluggable 
extensions for different parts of the manifest editor applications.

<PropsTable of={EditorProvider} />

Because we are using React context, a default context will be provided for the consumer components, ergo 
creating a provider is not necessary to be able to use the manifest editor components.

Also worth to menition that the `ManifestEditor` component creates a Provider 
for the applications and it also passes forward several properties in order to be 
able to extend or override the basic context.

## Base Context

The base context has 3 sections:

```js
{
  annotation: {
    ...
  },
  dragDrop: {
    ...
  },
  translation: {
    ...
  },
};
```
